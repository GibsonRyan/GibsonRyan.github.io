    <h2>The Silent Forest</h2>
    <div id="poem" name="poem">
        <p>The leaves are silent <br> A squirrel jumps from tree to tree<br> The branches rustle</p>
    </div>
    <p>This poem came to me as I was thinking about all of the times I saw wildlife while camping as a kid. I thought of calm walks through a forest of trees and silence broken by something moving close by.</p>

    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>One of the things I enjoy on a regular basis is running. I am currently training for a marathon in August. The thing I love most about running is the feeling of accomplishment that comes after a long run. I also feel much more healthy and strong when
        I am active.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy reading fantasy books. My favorite author at the moment is Brandon Sanderson. His books are some of the most interesting and engaging book I've ever read. I love when fantasy authors give little clues throughout the story about what's
        going to happen, and Brandon Sanderson does that really well.</p>
    <p>Another thing I enjoy is playing with my one-year-old son. He gets so excited about everything, and it's really fun to see him grow and develop more skills. He is learning to walk right now and is getting very close to being able to do it by himself.
        He just looks so proud of himself when he manages to go a couple steps.</p>
